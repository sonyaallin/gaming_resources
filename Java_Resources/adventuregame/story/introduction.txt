Welcome to a small game of Adventure. Its purpose is to
illustrate that you can make your own games, as you see fit.

To play, a player moves between locations and interacts with objects by
typing one or two word commands.

You can write your own game using this template! Hopefully it will
be fun to play by everyone.

LET THE GAME BEGIN.
