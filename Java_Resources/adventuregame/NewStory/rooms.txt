The Library of Whispers
You step into a dust-covered library. Scrolls float gently in the air.
A tall woman with glowing eyes smiles at you.
-Elandra:
Knowledge opens all doors. Seek the key, but listen to the silence between words.

-LOOK
You find a Silver Key hidden in a hollowed-out book titled Echoes of the Vault.
-Elandra:
You’ll need more than a key. Find what reflects truth in echoes.

A Stone Tablet sits on a pedestal with three dials: Whisper, Echo, Truth. An old dwarf with granite skin stands before it.

Got the key? Got the shard? Got the code? Then solve the puzzle, or be sealed forever.

The End
The tablet glows. The pedestal sinks. A hidden door opens to daylight.
-Gorrin:
Well done, traveler. You’ve passed the trial of mind and soul. Freedom is yours.
You emerge into the sunlit world, puzzle solved, truth found... and adventure calling again.
