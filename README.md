# Accessible Game Resources

This will be a repository where we can add code resources we find or create that are 
modular and, in theory, that can help others to build more accessible software.

We can create two different sets of these resources:

1. Resources built in Python
2. Resources for the Unity Game Engine
3. Resources in Java
